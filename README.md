# Learning-With-The-Sea
In MÃ©xico, when a pregnant mother goes to jail. The baby and the mother have to stay together until the baby will be 6 years. When the babies exit from the jail, they go to orphaned where they'll have the help to reintegrate to the society. Perhaps the kids have a lot of help, they don't have enough education to go to a public school.  My purpose is to use the gamification and the serious game to help them to learn maths.
